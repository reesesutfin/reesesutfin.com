feature-description: "These two recently commissioned mosaics were created with thousands of pieces of shattered mirror, set in a dark charcoal grout and custom framed in oiled steel. The hand laid pieces of mirror were tilted slightly to cause a fractal effect of the surrounding environment. When exposed to light, they create a stunning kaleidoscope of reflective beauty."
