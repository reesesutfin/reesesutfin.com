feature-description: "This beautiful bird is often called a sparrow hawk, which is a misnomer because Kestrels are actually part of the falcon family.  They are the smallest falcon member and easily noticed by their ability to hover in one spot while searching for prey. They have a graceful agility and are the most predominate falcon found in the U.S. - Acrylic on canvas 24&quot; x 30&quot;."
