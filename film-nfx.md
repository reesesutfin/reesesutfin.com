feature-description: "This sloth inspired creature was created for a music video for the band, Shasta.
The head was first sculpted in clay on top of a stone bust so it would custom fit the actor's head, like a helmet. Then it was casted and poured in latex and poly foam. The inspiration was to create a mythical creature that could evoke gentle to fierce qualities. ( video release March 2013, FX assistant - Micayla Grace )"
